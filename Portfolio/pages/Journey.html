            <h1>MY TECH JOURNEY</h1>
            <p>Hi there! I'm a second-year BSIT student, and this is where I share my journey in the world of 
                technology so far. I may still be new to all of this, but every success starts small. I'm putting 
                in the effort to grow little by little, one lesson at a time.</p>
            <p> Right now, I'm exploring the basics of coding, design, and digital tools that help bring ideas 
                to life. I find some topics confusing and others exciting, but every moment brings me closer to 
                success and helps me build the skills I‚Äôll need for the future I want.</p>
            <p> This page shows what I'm currently learning and practicing ‚Äî from the tools I‚Äôm using to the 
                concepts I‚Äôm trying to understand. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs honest, and it‚Äôs mine.</p>
